### Data Annotator
Nexus is a Python-based tool for extracting, annotating, and analyzing NIH grant project data. It leverages **Indra** for downloading the NIH data and **Gilda** for entity recognition and annotation of project titles and abstracts, enabling structured insights from large-scale NIH datasets.

- Parses and processes **NIH grant data** from CSV files using **Indra**
- Uses **Gilda** for named entity recognition in **project titles** and **abstracts**
- Outputs annotations in **JSONL** format for easy processing
- Handles missing data and ensures clean text processing
